        Hi it is I~~ Aurora ðŸ§¡! I love life, the universe, and everything to a fault ðŸ˜‚! I am soft spoken and like to imagine myself as smaller than the body. 
        I like to dance, sing. I thrive when my environment is tidy and my body is clean. I love to cook and eat; hopefully all that hummus goes to my hips!

        I don't front often, and when I do, Amp usually fronts with me. I don't have much contact with the other alters in the system, besides the elusive numbered alters
        which seem to influence us all (regardless of sub-system). When I do front though, I own it, baby!
